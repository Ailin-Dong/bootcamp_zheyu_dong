# Stage 10a — Linear Regression Modeling

This package contains:
- `notebooks/modeling_regression_team.ipynb`: Linear regression modeling with diagnostics.
- `data/raw/synthetic_regression.csv`: Synthetic dataset (auto-generated if no project dataset).
- `README.md`: Instructions.

## Steps
1. Open the notebook in Jupyter.
2. Run all cells to fit baseline model, compute R²/RMSE, and check residuals.
3. Review diagnostic plots for assumptions (linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, normality).
4. (Optional) Refit with transformed feature (x1²) to compare performance.
