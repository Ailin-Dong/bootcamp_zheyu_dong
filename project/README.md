# Hotel Price Forecast

## Problem Statement
Fluctuations in hotel prices are influenced by various factors such as booking lead time, seasonal demand, special events, and market competition. However, both consumers and hotel operators often lack accurate tools to anticipate these changes. Without reliable predictions, consumers may overpay for accommodations, while hotels may miss opportunities to optimize occupancy rates and maximize revenue.
Accurately predicting hotel prices, such as identifying the optimal number of days in advance to book or determining the cheapest periods in the year, can benefit both sides of the market. For hotels, such predictions enable more effective cost and revenue management through dynamic pricing strategies and demand forecasting. For consumers, they provide actionable guidance on when to book, allowing for significant cost savings. Developing a robust predictive model can therefore bridge the information gap, improving market efficiency and creating a win, win outcome for businesses and customers alike.

## Stakeholder & User
1) Consumers
2) Hotel Operators

## Useful Answer & Decision
The model would be predictive, in order to show how to order the cheapest hotels.

## Assumptions & Constraints
1) Historical data reflects pricing patterns
Past hotel price trends (affected by seasonality, booking lead time, and local events) are assumed to remain relevant for future predictions, provided there are no drastic market disruptions.
2) Key influencing factors can be quantified
Variables such as holidays, weather, and competitor pricing are assumed to be measurable and included in the dataset, though data availability and quality may limit completeness.
3) Pricing remains relatively stable in structure
The market's pricing mechanisms are assumed not to undergo sudden, unpredictable changes, but hotels may still make rapid adjustments in response to competition or short-term demand spikes.
4) Model performance is constrained by uncertainty in behavior
Both hotel strategies and consumer booking habits may shift due to economic, social, or regional factors, creating inherent limits to forecast accuracy despite advanced modeling.

## Known Unknowns / Risks
1) Unpredictable external shocks
Events such as pandemics, natural disasters, or political instability may cause sudden, unmodelled price changes.
2) Incomplete or biased data
Missing, outdated, or region-specific data may limit the model’s ability to generalize.
3) Changing market behavior
Shifts in hotel pricing strategies or consumer booking habits may reduce forecast accuracy over time.
